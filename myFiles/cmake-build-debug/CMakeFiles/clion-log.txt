CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findecbuild.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ecbuild", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ecbuild"
  (requested version 3.7) with any of the following names:

    ecbuildConfig.cmake
    ecbuild-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ecbuild" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ecbuild_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ecbuild" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
